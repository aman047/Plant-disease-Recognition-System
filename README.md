# 🌿 Plant Disease Recognition System

## 📌 Overview
The **Plant Disease Recognition System** is a deep learning-based solution for detecting plant diseases from images. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify plant leaves into different disease categories, helping farmers and researchers take preventive measures.

## 🚀 Features
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Model**: Trained using CNNs for accurate disease classification.
- 🌍 **Streamlit Web App**: Easy-to-use interface for disease prediction.
- 📊 **Data Analytics**: Insights on disease occurrence and trends (future scope).
